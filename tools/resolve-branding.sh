#
# Pre-pass for a merge between origin/main and bitedj/main, in either
# direction.  Both directions have the same job: keep the branding of the
# branch being merged *into*, whatever the incoming side says.  Which of the
# two modes below runs is picked from the state of the index, and -h prints
# this text.
#
# conflict mode -- "merge bitedj/main back into origin/main".
#
# The two repos shared no history, so every file that differs came back as an
# add/add conflict, and most of what differs is only the BiteDJ palette repaint
# -- 39 of the 40 conflicts in style.qss are nothing but #f15921 -> #c9372c and
# #488ab3 -> #855ea7.  Those are noise; this drops them so the interactive
# resolve-conflicts.sh only has to ask about the changes that carry meaning.
#
# Two rules, both "keep ours":
#
#   branding assets    listed in BRANDING_PATHS -- the logo and the recoloured
#                      icon.  Binary, never mergeable, always ours.
#
#   colour-managed     listed in COLOR_FILES.  A conflict block is resolved to
#                      ours when the two sides are identical once every colour
#                      literal is blanked out.  Any block with a real change in
#                      it is left alone, markers intact, for a human.
#
# Note on merge.conflictStyle: under diff3/zdiff3 and an empty merge base -- which
# is what an unrelated-history merge gives you -- git stops splitting and hands
# back the whole file as a single conflict block, which no rule can classify.  A
# colour-managed file that comes back that way is re-split from the index stages
# in plain style first, so the result does not depend on the caller's config.
#
# staged mode -- "merge main into bitedj-main", which is a squash merge.
#
# The branches share history now, so that direction does not conflict at all:
# git takes main's side of every branding file and stages it, and the BiteDJ
# repaint is gone from the squash with nothing to review.  There are no index
# stages to work from here, so the comparison is against HEAD (= ours = the
# branch being merged into), and the rules are:
#
#   branding assets    restored from HEAD wholesale, as in conflict mode.
#
#   colour-managed     the palette swaps are *learned* from the staged diff --
#                      a changed line whose two sides are identical once the
#                      colour literals are blanked names one swap -- and then
#                      applied to the whole staged file.  Learning rather than
#                      hardcoding keeps one list of colours, in the skin, and
#                      repainting the whole file rather than reverting hunks
#                      also catches main's *new* rules: the FX pane arrived
#                      with 59 lines of fresh QSS written in main's palette,
#                      which no revert of an existing line would have caught.
#                      A literal main mapped two different ways is left alone
#                      and reported, since that is not a repaint.
#
#   main-only          listed in MAIN_ONLY_PATHS.  Development scaffolding that
#                      lives on main and has deliberately never been part of
#                      the release branch.  Unstaged and removed from the
#                      worktree when the merge is what added them, so the
#                      commit that follows does not carry them over.
#
# A merge that conflicts in some files and takes the incoming side cleanly in
# others is both cases at once: resolve the conflicts, then run again with
# --mode staged to catch the branding that never conflicted.
#
# Files outside these lists are never touched, in either mode.  A file whose
# conflicts all resolve is staged; one with a block left is written back still
# conflicted and deliberately NOT staged.
#
# Exits 0 unless it could not write a file it was asked to resolve.
